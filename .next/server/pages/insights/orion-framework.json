We require <strong>2:1 minimum R:R</strong>, employ <strong>ATR-based stops</strong>, and track <strong>volatility and liquidity</strong> to avoid poor conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Execution notes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm with RSI/MACD slope, EMA200 trend context, and volume impulse thresholds.</li>\n<li>Move SL to breakeven at TP1 and trail after impulse continuation.</li>\n<li>Avoid thin books; we require sensible liquidity and ≤0.2% expected slippage for $1–3k tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We combine quantified rules with real operator judgment to preserve capital and sustain edge.</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
