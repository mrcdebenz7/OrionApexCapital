**Thesis**: Location quality dominates. We prioritize **foot traffic, transaction intent, and local demographics** over convenience alone.

## Site Selection Framework

Key criteria for placement evaluation:

1. **Traffic Volume**: Daily foot traffic minimum thresholds
2. **Transaction Intent**: Proximity to cash-preferred businesses
3. **Competition**: Existing ATM density analysis
4. **Accessibility**: 24/7 access vs. business-hours only
5. **Security**: Lighting, visibility, incident history

## Unit Economics

Target metrics per placement:

- **Monthly Revenue**: $150-250 (surcharge + interchange)
- **Monthly Costs**: $50-80 (cash, maintenance, location fee)
- **Net Monthly**: $80-170
- **Payback Period**: 12-18 months

## Operations Excellence

Our uptime discipline includes:

- **Cash Monitoring**: Daily balance checks, predictive refill scheduling
- **Maintenance**: Preventive service calendar, rapid response SLA
- **Reporting**: Real-time dashboards, automated alerts
- **Route Optimization**: Clustered placements for efficiency

## Scale Path

Current: 3 placements (proof of concept)  
Target: 6-8 placements by Q2 2026  
Objective: $18k-$25k annual net profit

Simple is scalable. We keep routing, repairs, and reconciliation clean.
