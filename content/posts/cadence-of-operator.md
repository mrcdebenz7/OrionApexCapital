excerpt: "Daily, weekly, monthly rhythms that compound execution quality."
---

We bias toward clear inputs, time-boxed work, and measurable outcomes. **Cadence beats intensity**.

## Daily Rhythm

- **Morning**: Review markets, check alerts, plan priorities
- **Execution Block**: 2-4 hour focused work window
- **Review**: Log outcomes, update tracking, prepare next day

## Weekly Cycle

- **Monday**: Set week priorities, review trading plan
- **Mid-week**: Ops reviews (ATM uptime, website metrics)
- **Friday**: Week close-out, performance review, adjustment notes

## Monthly Cadence

- **Week 1**: Financial close, P&L review, variance analysis
- **Week 2-3**: Strategic projects, system improvements
- **Week 4**: Planning next month, resource allocation

This structure creates **predictable progress** and prevents reactive drift.

The goal isn't perfectionâ€”it's **consistent execution** that compounds over time.
