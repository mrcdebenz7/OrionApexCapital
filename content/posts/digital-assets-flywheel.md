excerpt: "Our approach to acquiring and improving web properties, capturing cashflow, and recycling capital via resale."

**Acquire**: Clean SEO, legit content, and diversified monetization.  
**Improve**: UX, speed, affiliate/ads balance, SOPs, and content velocity.  
**Recycle**: Exit at better multiples; redeploy into the next edge.

Discipline compounds. We avoid hype and anchor to operator math.
