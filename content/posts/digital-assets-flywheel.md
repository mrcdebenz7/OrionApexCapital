excerpt: "Acquire quality, improve deliberately, recycle capital at better multiples."

**Acquire**: Clean SEO, legit content, diversified monetization.

**Improve**: UX, speed, affiliate/ads balance, SOPs, content velocity.

**Recycle**: Exit at better multiples; redeploy into the next edge.

Discipline compounds. We avoid hype and anchor to operator math.

## The Acquisition Filter

We look for assets with:

- Established traffic patterns (organic + diversified)
- Multiple revenue streams (ads, affiliate, product)
- Clean technical foundation (no spam, no penalties)
- Room for operational improvement

## The Improvement Playbook

Once acquired, we systematically enhance:

1. **Technical**: Page speed, mobile optimization, Core Web Vitals
2. **Content**: Fill gaps, update stale posts, improve CTAs
3. **Monetization**: Test new networks, optimize ad placement, add affiliate angles
4. **Systems**: Document SOPs, automate reporting, streamline workflows

## The Recycling Strategy

When cashflow stabilizes and improvements plateau, we exit at improved multiples and redeploy capital into the next opportunity.

This creates a compounding loop: better execution → stronger exits → more deployment capital.
