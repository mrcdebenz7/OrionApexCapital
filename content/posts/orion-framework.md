> *Nothing here is financial advice.*

We focus on **short-term setups (≤72h)** in scalp, breakout, and swing categories, built on **multi-timeframe confluence** (1H + 4H/D). We require **2:1 minimum R:R**, employ **ATR-based stops**, and track **volatility and liquidity** to avoid poor conditions.

**Execution notes:**
- Confirm with RSI/MACD slope, EMA200 trend context, and volume impulse thresholds.
- Move SL to breakeven at TP1 and trail after impulse continuation.
- Avoid thin books; we require sensible liquidity and ≤0.2% expected slippage for $1–3k tickets.

We combine quantified rules with real operator judgment to preserve capital and sustain edge.
