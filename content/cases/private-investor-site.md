## Problem

A private investment firm was managing investor communications through ad-hoc PDFs and email threads. Version control was messy, and prospective LPs had inconsistent access to fund documents.

## Approach

We built a secure microsite with:

- **Structured Disclosures**: Fund terms, strategy overview, risk factors
- **FAQ Section**: Common questions pre-answered
- **Document Library**: Versioned documents with access logs
- **Password Protection**: Simple gate for qualified investors

## Deliverables

- Next.js microsite deployed on Vercel
- CMS integration for document updates
- Password-protected sections
- Mobile-responsive design

## Impact

- **Diligence Speed**: LPs could review materials independently
- **Version Control**: Single source of truth for fund documents
- **Professional Signal**: Elevated perception of operational sophistication
- **Time Saved**: Reduced back-and-forth email threads by ~40%

## Stack & Tools

- Next.js for static site generation
- Vercel for hosting and edge functions
- Markdown for content management
- Simple password gate (no CMS required)

## Lessons

Investor relations benefit from the same operational discipline as product:

- **Clarity** over cleverness
- **Consistency** in messaging
- **Accessibility** for qualified parties
- **Version control** to avoid confusion
