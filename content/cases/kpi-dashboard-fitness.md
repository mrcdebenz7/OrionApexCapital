## Problem

A multi-location fitness operator was managing club performance through disconnected spreadsheets and manual weekly roll-ups. Regional managers spent 6-8 hours per week aggregating data, and the lag time prevented timely intervention on retention and sales metrics.

## Approach

We built a unified data model that:

- Automated imports from membership system via API
- Centralized metrics in BigQuery
- Created a live Looker Studio dashboard
- Established single source of truth for KPIs

## Deliverables

- **Live Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into member retention, sales pipeline, class attendance
- **SOP Documentation**: Step-by-step guide for dashboard maintenance
- **Handoff Video**: Training for regional managers and HQ team

## Impact

- **Retention**: +2.8 percentage points improvement through earlier intervention
- **Time Saved**: 6-8 hrs/week per regional manager
- **Operational**: Higher compliance with CCS booking protocols
- **Decision Speed**: Same-day visibility vs. week-delayed reporting

## Stack & Tools

- Google AppScript for API integration
- BigQuery for data warehouse
- Looker Studio for visualization
- Existing membership system (Club OS)
