## Problem

An ATM operator was experiencing unpredictable outages and overfilling under variable traffic conditions. Downtime averaged 8-12% monthly, and cash logistics were reactive rather than predictive.

## Approach

We implemented:

- **Route Scoring**: Prioritized service by transaction volume and downtime risk
- **Alerting System**: Real-time notifications for low cash, hardware errors
- **Refill Thresholds**: Dynamic targets based on historical transaction patterns
- **SLA Framework**: Clear service windows and escalation paths

## Deliverables

- Airtable ops dashboard with automated alerts
- Route optimization schedule
- Cash forecasting model
- Maintenance SOP documentation

## Impact

- **Downtime**: Reduced from 8-12% to 5-6% (34% improvement)
- **Cash Cycles**: Tightened float utilization; fewer emergency runs
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced service truck rolls by 20%
- **Uptime Visibility**: Real-time monitoring vs. reactive discovery

## Stack & Tools

- Airtable for operations tracking
- Zapier for alert automation
- Google Sheets for cash forecasting
- SMS notifications via Twilio
