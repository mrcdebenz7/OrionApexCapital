## Problem

A quantitative trading team had strong technical depth but struggled to communicate their edge to non-technical investors. The deck was heavy on backtests and formulas, light on risk controls and practical execution.

## Approach

We reframed the narrative:

1. **Problem → Edge → Proof**: Restructured flow to lead with market inefficiency, then solution
2. **Risk First**: Added explicit risk controls, position sizing, drawdown management
3. **Metrics That Matter**: Highlighted Sharpe, max drawdown, daily P&L distribution
4. **Visual Clarity**: Simplified charts; removed technical jargon where unnecessary

## Deliverables

- Revised pitch deck (20 slides → 14 slides)
- Executive summary (1-pager)
- Investor FAQ document
- Presentation coaching notes

## Impact

- **Clarity**: Non-technical investors could understand the strategy
- **Signal**: Higher-quality questions from investors during diligence
- **Confidence**: Team felt prepared to defend approach under scrutiny
- **Next Steps**: Progressed to term sheet negotiations with 2 investors

## Lessons

Investors care about:

- **Risk management** more than return targets
- **Operational details** (who monitors? what happens in crisis?)
- **Team resilience** (how do you handle drawdowns?)

Technical brilliance needs a translation layer for capital allocation.
